# Icons for Kando

This directory contains the sources for the icons used in Kando. The `create.sh` script can be used on Linux and macOS to create all the icons for all platforms. It requires `inkscape`, `svgo` and `imagaemagick` to be installed.

The repository comes with a dispatchable GitHub action that runs this script and uploads the results as artifact.
